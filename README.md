#basketball

Recently, I've been trying to come up with a way to use machine learning to predict the outcome of basketball games for the purpose of spread betting.  I have tried several different methods including logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers, each with varying degrees of success.  The method which I choose to present here is a simulation-driven model.  I have devised a way to simulate an entire basketball game one possession at a time.  If I want to predict the outcome of a future game, I can simulate it many times and observe the distribution of outcomes produced by the model.  **bball_sim.pdf** describes my methods in detail.  I used the IPython Notebook for my work, which can be found in **bballSimN2.ipynb**.  I've also included the raw Python code.
